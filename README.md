# Street_Fighter_Game
As a skilled web developer, I have developed a "Street Fighter" game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS. This project provides users with an engaging and interactive experience, allowing them to battle it out in a virtual fighting arena.

The game features a 2D user interface that is visually appealing and easy to navigate. Players can choose from a range of characters and backgrounds, with all game elements rendered using JavaScript for a smooth and responsive gameplay experience.

To build this project, I utilized my knowledge of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a compelling and engaging game that will provide hours of entertainment for users. I also implemented advanced techniques such as collision detection and animation to create a realistic fighting experience.

Overall, the "Street Fighter" game project showcases my skills as a web developer and demonstrates my ability to create engaging and interactive web applications using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
